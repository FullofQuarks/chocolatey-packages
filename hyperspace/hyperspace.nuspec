    <summary>The new beautiful, fluffy client for the fediverse written in TypeScript and React</summary>
    <description>Hyperspace is the fluffiest client for Mastodon and other fediverse networks written in TypeScript and React. Hyperspace offers a fun, clean, fast, and responsive design that scales beautifully across devices and enhances the fediverse experience.
    * __Responsive by design__: Hyperspace is beautifully designed to put your content front and center and bring a familiar experience to Mastodon. View threads and profiles with ease and compose anywhere with the compose button. And, of course, Hyperspace scales across devices beautifully, providing the same experience anywhere.
    * __Customizable__: Hyperspace allows customization and configuration at every level, from the server level with branding and instance setup, down to the user level with dark mode, custom themes, and multi-user account support. And, if the default configuration settings aren't enough, anyone can make their own version of Hyperspace with custom additions.
    * __Open-source__: Hyperspace is free (libre) and open-source software. Licensed under the Non-Violent Public License, anyone can modify, redistribute, or contribute to the Hyperspace project without restriction. Hyperspace is written in TypeScript and takes advantage of multiple open-source libraries and projects such as React, Megalodon, and Material-UI, so web and Node.js developers will feel right at home.
